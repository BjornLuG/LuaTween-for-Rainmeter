## How to use
Here's a quick walkthrough on how to use LuaTween

1. Clone this repository and unzip it. Go to *Skins* > *LuaTween* > *@Resources* folder, the two scripts, ***Tweener.lua*** and ***tween.lua*** are the main scripts of this project. (Credits to [tween.lua](https://github.com/kikito/tween.lua) that provided the tween functions)

2. Copy both of the scripts to any skins that uses them. (**NOTE:** both the scripts must be located under the **same** folder, otherwise it'll not work)

3. In the skin, create a Script Measure that points to the ***Tweener.lua*** file. Follow the syntax and instructions to create tweens (Check out the skins provided in the repo to see how to create tweens or follow the tutorial linked below)
